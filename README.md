Payeezy Java SDK

Payeezy Java SDK is built to make developers life easy to integrate with the Payeezy API (https://developers.payeezy.com) for processing payements with various payment methods. Download the SDK, install it and start testing against the sandbox environment with developer credentials.

To install it, run java -jar payeezy-java-client-1.0.jar and answer the questions to setup your credentials. Inputs apikey, token, secret, js_security_key (if you are transarmor enabled and plan on making token based transactions) and environment are mandatory. Choose sandbox if you are trying the documented api's. This will create a file .payeezy.properties in your home directory with the configuration settings for the SDK.  You can regenerate this file anytime by rerunning, or you may edit the settings manually.

1) Add the following dependency for Maven in your pom.xml

	```
		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.firstdata.payeezy</groupId>
			<artifactId>payeezy-java-client</artifactId>
			<version>1.0</version>
		</dependency>
	```

2) Create your configuration file with one of the following
	* Run java -jar payeezy-java-client-1.0.jar.	
	* Add file .payeezy.properties to your home directory with the correct properties in it.

PayeezyClientHelper provides different methods to integrate with different transactions seemlessly. The SDK is supplied with objects to build your transaction requests easily and pass to the appropriate functions defined in PayeezyClientHelper.

You can use the alternative constructor PayeezyClientHelper(Properties properties) to pass the properties without the need of running the client to setup your payeezy configuration properties.

Please refer to PayeezyClientHelper java documentation to understand the various methods available.
